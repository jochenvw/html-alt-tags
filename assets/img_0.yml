  Epson EcoTank L3560 is a multifunction A4 inkjet printer designed for home
  and small office use. Manufactured by Epson, a global imaging and printing
  technology company, the EcoTank series replaces traditional ink cartridges
  with refillable high-capacity ink tanks to reduce running costs and plastic
  waste.

  The device supports print, scan, and copy functions in a compact desktop
  form factor. It features built-in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct connectivity,
  enabling wireless printing from laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
  Compatibility includes Apple AirPrint, Mopria, and Epson Connect via the
  Epson Smart Panel mobile application. A 3.7 cm colour LCD screen provides
  local device control and status monitoring.

  The EcoTank system includes high-yield ink bottles with a key-lock refill
  mechanism designed to minimise spills and incorrect filling. The box
  includes enough ink for up to approximately 6,600 black pages and 5,900
  colour pages, marketed as up to three years of ink included depending on
  usage patterns.

  Printing technology is based on Epson PrecisionCore printhead architecture
  with Variable-Sized Droplet Technology. Maximum print resolution reaches
  up to 4800 x 1200 dpi. ISO print speeds are approximately 15 pages per
  minute (mono) and 8 pages per minute (colour). Borderless photo printing
  is supported up to 10 x 15 cm.

  The integrated flatbed scanner offers up to 1200 x 2400 dpi optical
  resolution for document and image scanning. Standard A4 media handling
  is supported via a rear paper tray suitable for plain paper, envelopes,
  and photo media. Duplex printing is manual.

  The design emphasises cost efficiency, low cost per page, wireless
  flexibility, and reduced environmental impact through cartridge-free
  printing and use of recycled plastics in selected components.
